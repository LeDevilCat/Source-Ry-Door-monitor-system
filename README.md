# 🚪 A0-35 Door Monitoring App

A real-time **door monitoring system** for the Tampere University of Applied Sciences ICT club Source's clubroom (A0-35).  
The project tracks whether the door is open or closed, logs historical data, and provides a responsive dashboard with analytics.

## ✨ Features

- **Live Door Status:** Instantly see if the door is open or closed.  
- **Real-Time Updates:** Powered by Firebase Firestore listeners.  
- **Analytics:** Charts for daily, weekly, and monthly patterns.  
- **Responsive Design:** Works on info screens, desktops, tablets, and mobile.

## 🚦 How It Works

- **Backend (Raspberry Pi & Python):**  
  Magnetic switch → updates Firestore with every open/close event.  

- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):**  
  Fetches live status & history → updates UI and charts in real time.
